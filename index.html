        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>This project came about because I really needed to figure out what the temperature was in my apartment, and not just at any given time, but over the course of the day. My building's thermostat can be programmed to adjust itself at certain times, but it's tricky to figure out what temperature and at what times the thermostat should be programmed for. This project allows me to figure out if there are any times of the day that warrant a thermostat adjustment.</p>

        <p>There are many different ways of recording temperatures over time. There are even a plethora of ways to publish those readings the web right out of the box. As a vacation project I wanted to build something that allowed me to use a bunch of different tools to accomplish the same thing.</p>

        <h3>Why Twine?</h3>

        <p>Twine from Supermechanical is a nifty little piece of hardware. It has a thermometer and and accelerometer built in (with the option to add other sensors). It's only interface is through their <a href="http://twine.cc" target="_blank">cloud service</a> which is a bummer, but I've been wanting to play with one ever since their <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/supermechanical/twine-listen-to-your-world-talk-to-the-internet" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a>.</p>

        <h3>Why Raspberry Pi?</h3>

        <p>A <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/998" target="_blank">$40</a> computer? What's not to love?</p>

        <p>I only have one Pi, but I love it. In fact I have several different SD cards for all of my different projects. Since this project is using my only Pi, I guess I'm gonna have to buy another one. :)</p>

        <h3>Why Ruby?</h3>

        <p><a href="http://ruby-lang.org" target="_blank">Ruby</a> is an absolutely fast (at least to program) and fun language. There are of other languages (especially for physical computing), but for a holiday project, this was my weapon of choice. Perhaps next year, I will port the project to Python.</p>

        <h3>Why Cron?</h3>

        <p>As the gold standard in scheduling for POSIX systems it's fine. Not fancy by any means, I mean it's no upstart or even launchd.</p>

        <h3>Why Yahoo! Weather API?</h3>

        <p>The <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/weather/" target="_blank">Yahoo! Weather API</a> is kinda weird. That don't care about your zip code or city name. They want to know what your WOEID is. Oh, you don't know what a WOEID is? That's probably because it's a Yahoo! invention and not at very specific or easy to identify. All that being said, weather is hard, and once you get the <a href="http://woeid.rosselliot.co.nz/" target="_blank">WOEID</a>, working with the Yahoo! Weather API is pretty nice.</p>

        <h3>Why Google Drive?</h3>

        <p>Ugh. It's ubiquitous at this point. It's not that great, but it's getting better. The part of the service that I was keen to use was the <a href="https://developers.google.com/chart" target="_blank">chart API</a>. It's kinda brilliant, and it's got massive potential. It doesn't even have to be used with Google Drive, but the tight ecosystem certainly makes life easier.</p>

        <h3>Why Github Pages?</h3>

        <p>I LOVE YOU GITHUB!!!! Not only do they host the code, but they provide the space and bandwidth to serve project pages!? Oh, and if you get a chance to go to local <a href="https://github.com/blog/category/drinkup" target="_blank">drinkup</a> you should.</p>

        <h3>Why ContrarySheep?</h3>
